      title: Ecological Summary - Eligans Impar
      author: 
    text: "Dubbed Eligans Impar, this particular genus of cows unique to Planet X
      present with many similarities to terran cattle. Herds of these space cows
      have horns and cloven hooves, engage in cud chewing, and prefer isolation from
      other species. Stocking density, the number of animals within a specified area,
      is presumed to have strict requirements. \r\n\nEligans Impar are exclusively
      herbivores, competing over food sources with CapraX Zeigrun. Unlike their goat
      companions, space cows were not observed with predatory tendencies. Herds have
      been recorded at Caloris Basin, Marineris Grasslands, and the outskirts of
      the Pastillion Mountain Range."

    text: "I thought this gig was going to be easier, honestly. I\u2019m on the second
      group of cattle-type species from Planet X. Dr. Star has labeled them...eligans
      impar? Like an impala, I guess. They looked like cows, at first. As I started
      to feed them, I quickly realized they\u2019re nothing like Terran cows. They
      didn\u2019t even want to eat some hay we prepared! Stubborn things only wanted
      what we were giving the space goats. Y\u2019know, I swear to the gods, I thought
      I heard one talk. I mean, it was probably just a moo. And we\u2019ve been travelling
      understaffed with so many endangered species, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m hearing
      things."

      title: Observation Log Session #12
      author: Juno Fornax
    text: If I thought golden trees were weird...wow. A herd of approximately 20
      Eligans Impar finally allowed me to approach within 10 feet. After 3 observation
      sessions and 5 different encounters with this specific herd, they seem to be
      more open. Almost like canines, the cows would often tilt their heads and sniff
      my extremities. They do not appear to have interacted with other human(oid)s,
      which aligns with the lack of intelligent peoples thus far.

      title: Research Abstract
      author: Dr. Aurora Star
    text: 'Cow-moo-nication: Lack of Eligans Impar Vocalization



      Previous
      research shows that Terran mothers and calves show individuality in vocalizations.
      Natura Serva 22 has isolated five sets of mothers and calves. As found in Terran
      cattle, it is highly likely that these cows will be able to recognize other
      members of their herd through vocalizations. However, current acoustic analyses
      programs have not detected any vocalization from this set. Other enclosures
      have reported similar silence from their individual herds. Natura Serva 22
      will begin integrating vocal cue studies in all Eligans Impar enclosures to
      observe the degree to which the cattle do or do not vocalize. The herds do
      appear to interact with each other and behave similarly to Terran cows, which
      suggests an alternative method of communication.'
